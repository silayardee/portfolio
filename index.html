      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
        6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
        7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
          - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).

                  I'm an embedded software engineer trying to pivot into software outside of the aviation industry. I've been wading in the waters of mobile software development, but I managed to get side-tracked into the the backend of the overall stack. The front end, which I've always imagined would be an intersection of creative design and technology, has been the part that I've avoided for the longest time. Creativity has never been my strength. I'm hoping that dabbling in front end development will slowly nibble away at the resistance that I've had. Becoming skilled at the front end would be nice, but I'm sure that it will be quite the journey.
